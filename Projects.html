    <h2>Minor Project</h2>

        <b> Project Title  :  TOUCHLESS SWITCHBOARD FOR THE POST COVID WORLD BY USING ARDUINO & RELAYS</b><br><br>
        <b> Description</b>:  The main objective of this project is As Covid-19 is still rampant we need to be cautious. Wearing mask, social distancing, and washing or sanitising our hands properly from time to time is absolutely necessary to avoid it. 
        As a precaution, we should also avoid touching any item including the electrical switches as far as possible. In public places, schools, and offices the electrical switchboards are touched by one and all, 
        and so can pass on the virus from one person to many.

        Here is a solution in the form of a 4-channel touchless switchboard. Arduino Uno as the heart of the project, surrounded by four ultrasonic sound sensors, offers a simple, 
        low-cost, and novel solution. The switches can be turned on and off alternately by just placing a hand next to the ultrasonic sound sensors on the device, withoutÂ touching.

    <h2>Major Project</h2>

        <b>Project Title     : MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES FOR CYBER ATTACK DETECTION</b><br><br>
        <b>Description </b>  : The main objective of this project is we have designed a web application by using machine learning algorithms and it  can be used to train and detect if there has been a cyber attack. 
        The increased usage of cloud services, growing number of users, changes in network infrastructure that connect devices running mobile operating systems,
        and constantly evolving network technology cause novel challenges for cyber security that have never been foreseen before.
        Recently there is an increasing number of security incidents reported all over the world. This situation is strongly related to the fact that recently 
        there is also an increasing number of mobile devices users that form the population of connect-from-anywhere terminals that regularly test the traditional
        boundaries of network security
